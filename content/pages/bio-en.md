Traditional CV available [here](../pdfs/CV.pdf) 

## The early years (1984-2002)
I was born in 1984 in the Spanish town of Guadalajara, 50 km north-east from Madrid. There I attended high school between 1998 and 2002.

As usually happens with happy childhoods, there's not much to tell about it.

## The physics years (2002-2012)
In 2002 I start studying physics at _Universidad Complutense de Madrid_, while living and working as maths tutor in Guadalajara. The distance between Guadalajara and Madrid represented a daily 1.5 hour bus travel to get to the faculty, and another 1.5 hour to return back home. The daily commuting, and my work, forced me to enroll as a half-time student and graduate slower than I wanted to.

In 2012 I get my _Licenciatura_ (spanish equivalent of masters' degree, 5 years long) in Physics, with the specialization in _Física fundamental_ (theoretical physics).

## The engineering years (2012-2015)
In 2012, one month after getting my title, I start working as _Research and Development Engineer_ for _Indizen Optical Technologies_. Based in Madrid, _IOT_ is a company focused on the design of ophthalmic lenses. The team I worked at took care of the numerical simulations, optimization of surfaces' shapes, ray tracing, design of clinical trials, software development and maintenance and the investigation of new technologies and methods. To put it short: everything related to the physics and math behind the lens making process.

In those years, my interest in programming languages and methods grew exponentially.

## The applied mathematics years (2015-now)
In 2015 I receive a _Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher_ grant in order to conduct a PhD in applied mathematics at _Wageningen University_, the Netherlands. The project is part of the [CRITICS](http://www.criticsitn.eu/wp/) (CRItical Transitions In Complex Systems) consortium, coordinated by _Imperial College London_.

My research is focused on modeling and simulating biological systems described by non-linear dynamics, and characterizing observables for determining early warning signals of catastrophic shifts. My main working tools are dynamical systems theory (with a focus on bifurcation analysis) and numerical simulations.

My position as **physicist** hired as a **mathematician** by an aquatic **ecology** department makes a bit difficult to classify what kind of science I'm exactly doing!

## Science communication (2011-now)
With more than two million visits per month, [naukas.com](http://naukas.com/) is the larger science communication website in spanish language. I collaborate with them regularly, mostly in the form of written short essays about physics, mathematics and engineering, some of them featuring interactive visualizations. Since 2011, and under the patronage of the Basque Country University, we organize a yearly science communication festival that, in the last editions, congregated an audience of a few thousands.

These activities have been the background _"soundtrack"_ of the last years.

All my science communication activity is listed [here]({filename}/pages/sci-comm-en.md).
