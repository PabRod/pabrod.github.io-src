Summary: A short biography

## The early years (1984-2002)
I was born in 1984 in the Spanish town of Guadalajara, 50 km north-east from Madrid. There I attended high school between 1998 and 2002.

As most happy childhoods, it lacks any narrative interest.

## The physics years (2002-2012)
In 2002 I start studying physics at _Universidad Complutense de Madrid_, while living and working as maths tutor in Guadalajara. The distance between Guadalajara and Madrid represented a daily 1.5 hour bus travel to get to the faculty, and another 1.5 hour to return back home. The daily commuting, and my work, forced me to enroll as a half-time student and graduate slower than I wanted to.

In 2012 I get my _Licenciatura_ (spanish equivalent of masters' degree, 5 years long) in Physics, with the specialization in _Física fundamental_ (theoretical physics).

## The engineering years (2012-2015)
In 2012, one month after getting my title, I start working as _Research and Development Engineer_ for _Indizen Optical Technologies_, an ophthalmic lens designing company based in Madrid. The team I worked at takes care of the numerical simulations, the software development and maintenance, the investigation of new technologies and everything related to the physics and math of the process behind the scenes.

In those years, my interest in programming languages and methods grew exponentially.

## The multidisciplinary years (2015-now)
In 2015 I receive a _Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher_ grant in order to conduct a PhD at _Wageningen University_, the Netherlands.

My research is focused on modeling and simulating biological systems described by non-linear dynamics, and characterizing observables for determining early warning signals of catastrophic shifts. My main working tools are dynamical systems theory (with a focus on bifurcation analysis) and numerical simulations.

My position as **physicist** hired as a **mathematician** by an aquatic **ecology** department makes a bit difficult to classify what kind of science I'm exactly doing!

## Science communication (2011-now)
In 2011 I start collaborating with [naukas.com](http://fuga.naukas.com). With more than 2 million visits per month, _Naukas_ is the biggest online magazine about science communication in Spanish language. It is also a very active community, providing not only short essays but also classes, talks, interactive simulations, one annual congress (at least) and even collaborations with radio and tv shows.

These activities have been the background _"soundtrack"_ of the last years.

All my science communication activity is listed [here]({filename}/pages/sci-comm-en.md).
