Summary: Some things I want to share

## Talks
Since 2013, I give at least one popular science talk per year in a theater. Here I show those talks with english subtitles. For a full list, click [here](https://pabrod.github.io/pages/sci-comm-en.html#sci-comm).

## Blog
I write since 2011 for [Naukas.com](https://naukas.com), the largest science communication web-magazine in Spanish language. My blog, [_Fuga de cerebros_](https://fuga.naukas.com) (Brain drain), focuses in physics, mathematics, and the experience of emigrated scientists. For a full list of my texts (some of them in English), click [here](https://pabrod.github.io/pages/sci-comm-en.html#sci-comm).
