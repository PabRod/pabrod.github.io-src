Summary: About me

Since 2012, I hold a _Licenciatura_ on theoretical physics (Universidad Complutense de Madrid), equivalent to a 5-year master's degree in the Spanish educational system.

I am currently carrying out a PhD as _Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher_ at _Wageningen University_, the Netherlands. My research is focused on modeling and simulating biological systems described by non-linear dynamics, and characterizing observables for determining early warning signals of catastrophic shifts.

In my free time, I participate enthusiastically in various science communication and science teaching projects, being my collaborations with [naukas.com](http://fuga.naukas.com) the main one. With more than 2 million visits per month, _Naukas_ is the biggest online magazine about science communication in Spanish language. I've also participated in speeches at universities, theaters, radio, and even TV shows.
