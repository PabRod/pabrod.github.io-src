## Title
Neutral competition and chaos. An example of reproducible research

##  Abstract
Have you ever thought of how many lines of scientific code are hidden in researcher's hard drives? Have you ever tried to reproduce a complicated algorithm described only with words on a scientific publication? In this talk, I will use my recently released paper as a case study to briefly review the technical possibilities and difficulties regarding publishing, citing and maintaining scientific code.
