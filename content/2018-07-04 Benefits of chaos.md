## Title
Competition, diversity and the benefits of chaos

##  Abstract
In this talk we'll explore how chaos can be the driver not only of unpredictability and disorder, but also of diversity inside an ecosystem. The analysis performed can be easily adapted and generalized to different kinds of competition systems, both inside and outside biology.
