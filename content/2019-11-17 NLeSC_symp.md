Summary: How software development shaped the way I write science, 21 November 2019, National eScience Symposium 2019. Amsterdam
Comments: True

A few months ago, I informally presented an earlier version of this talk at the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/) (NLeSC). Two remarkable things happened after that:

1. Now I am an _eScience Engineer_ at NLeSC.
2. They invited me to give the talk again. This time in a less informal setting: the [National eScience Symposium](https://www.esciencesymposium2019.nl), and in a less informal venue: the Ajax stadium

## Title
How software development shaped the way I write science

##  Abstract
When we say that scientific papers are complex, we tend to think that their contents are complex. While this is true, there is much more: a paper itself is a complex form of communication. In this short talk I'll explain how my years in the industry of software development dramatically changed the way I write scientific publications.
