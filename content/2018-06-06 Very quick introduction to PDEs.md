##  Quick introduction to Partial Differential Equations
On Thursday 7th, I'll give a crash course on partial differential equations at Wageningen University. Due to the diversity of backgrounds of the attendants, I'll try to focus in the key concepts, using graphical approaches as much as I can. Later on, we'll move forward to the numerical approach.

## Outline
1. What's the difference between partial and ordinary differential equations?
* Vector calculus in a nutshell
* Classical PDEs
* Classical boundary conditions
* Hand-on examples with _Matlab_

## Requirements
Please bring your laptop. The numerical examples will be solved using _Matlab's PDE Toolbox_.

## Materials
The slides and some code examples are available at [this link](https://github.com/PabRod/intro-to-pdes).

## Spacetime coordinates
* 7 June 2018, 13:30-16:30.
* Room E.111, Lumen.
