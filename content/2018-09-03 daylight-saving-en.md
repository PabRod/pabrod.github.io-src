_This is a translation of the essay "Interactivo: ¿Cómo me afecta el cambio de hora?", originally published [here](https://fuga.naukas.com/2018/09/02/interactivo-como-me-afecta-el-cambio-de-hora/) in Spanish._

The possibility of cancelling daylight saving time in the European Union has been one of the highlights of the week.

In order to shed some light over this (surprisingly) controversial topic, I made this interactive visualization. It allows to predict the daylight hours in several Spanish cities and towns, under the different possible scenarios.
